# travelGram originally cardGame

## Explanation

This app serves as a way for a user to create a travel blog that details some of the places they've been and allow people to see and post comments about it. The idea originally started as a way for someone and their friends to be able to all post their travel plans and interact with each other on a centralized hub. This is the first step towards achieving that.

## Installation Instructions

`npm install`

## Technologies Used

The app is build with html, css, javascript, and runs on React. The backend is handled on mongoDB and express while the site is hosted on Heroku.

We started off this project by simply making sure we had achieved full CRUD functionality by writing the routes needed for all the post interactions. Once this operational, we set out to adjust the UI to be more user friendly. This included things such as ordering of the post cards and rearranging where the post, edit, and comment options were rendered. After getting comments to work, which was arguably the most difficult part, the rest was just CSS.

## Unsolved Problems

We had originally set out to write an app that would be similar to Blizzard's Hearthstone card game but quickly realized we did not have the knowledge yet to be able to take on such a monumentous task. It is something we hope to be able to do not too far along in the future though when we have a more comprehensive understanding of REACT and gain more insight into its full functionality.

## What We Learned

We have a better understanding now of how to tie the controllers, models, views setup with REACT.
